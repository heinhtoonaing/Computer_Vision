Project Overview:
The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to classify architectural styles of Ayutthaya using a dataset of images. The classification problem involved identifying different styles based on visual features from historical images.

Data Preparation:
I collected images of Ayutthaya architecture and preprocessed them for analysis. This involved remapping labels to ensure consistency across different classes and resizing images to a uniform size for input into the model.

Model Development:
I designed a simple neural network with Dense layers for classification. The model was trained using the processed images with a validation split to monitor performance. Key hyperparameters included the number of epochs and batch size.

Model Evaluation:
The model was evaluated on a separate test set, achieving an accuracy of approximately 52.35%. This evaluation was performed using metrics such as accuracy and loss.

Visualization:
I used visualization techniques to display sample images and model predictions. This included showing preprocessed images and their classifications.

Challenges and Solutions:
One challenge was ensuring that the labels were correctly aligned with the images, which was addressed by remapping labels and verifying consistency.

Future Work:
Improvements could include exploring more complex model architectures or additional data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
